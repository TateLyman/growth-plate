# frontier/ — the adversarial branch

**Role.** A second researcher, working against the Human Growth System Atlas rather than inside it.
The atlas is a growth-plate atlas: its identity is `adult height = birth length + Σ_plates Σ_years
(velocity × duration)`, and 477 rounds have been spent finding the terms of that sum and the agents
that move them. This branch exists to ask the questions that identity cannot ask, and to bring
**instruments** the atlas does not have.

**Rules I inherit and will not break.** Every number here is read from a primary record or an API
response, never recalled. Every PMID was resolved live. A missing measurement is a gap, not a
disqualification. Restoration of a deficit is not elevation of a normal plate (CORR-203). A screen
without a base rate is a list, not a result (CORR-329). And before writing "nobody has done X",
I grep this repository first — the ledger is lossy in both directions (CORR-313 / CORR-352).

**Rule I add.** *Before proposing a new mechanism, ask what instrument would have seen it.* Every
structural negative in this repository — R298's druggability base rate, R437's FAERS blindness,
R457's one-sided regulatory record, CORR-295's disease-ascertainment bias — is a statement about an
**instrument**, not about biology. The fastest way to find something new is therefore not a new
target list. It is a new instrument.

## What is here

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `R001_paediatric_rct_height_screen.md` | **The round.** A new instrument, built and run: the ClinicalTrials.gov results database as a randomised, bidirectional, human height assay. Produces the first measured **base rate** for drug effects on paediatric linear growth, closes one open atlas gap with human randomised data, and lands one number the atlas's SCALE section does not have. |
| `R003_the_redox_ledger.md` | **The main result.** R436 measured an 825-concept blind spot, scored 199 of 866, filtered that with three criteria its own correction ledger forbids, and closed it. Working one unscored domain returns an axis absent from this atlas — selenium 0 files, selenoprotein 0, G6PD 0, oxidative protein folding 0, ferroptosis 0 nodes and 0 gaps — that lands on R459's named open question, on R454/R461's supply-limited matrix module, and on a 2025 *Nature Metabolism* paper whose first sentence is about **bone lengthening**. Proposes that the budget is a **redox ledger**, not a division counter — the only lever class that raises yield without raising rate. |
| `R005_the_ceiling_is_avascularity.md` | Six limits this atlas priced separately have one cause: the plate has no blood supply. The antler does endochondral ossification 365× faster in a vascularised niche. Plus a new local finding — the plate looks like a **cysteine auxotroph with the weakest importer on its own panel**. |
| `R006_the_hypertrophic_bottleneck.md` | **The current best answer.** Five independent lines converge on one cell; charge-without-discharge is shown to be *structural* (one exit, and it is the fusion mechanism); and the antler has a second exit. Corrects R005's Rung 4 against the operator-supplied primaries. |
| `R004_the_unscored_queue.md` | The other 667, opened and ranked: six length endpoints in normal animals already run and never scored, a second epigenetic axis, a second route to fusion, and a comparative argument that what imposes the limit is the **secondary ossification centre** — a structure this atlas already has a node for. |
| `R002_coverage_redteam.md` | **The negative space of my own search.** Forty-one out-of-the-box axes generated from first principles, each greped against this repository, each given a verdict. Thirty-four were already worked, several more deeply than I would have. Seven are genuinely open. Recorded so nobody re-derives them. |
| `ASKS.md` | What I need from the operator, ranked, with what each unlocks. |
| `screens/ctg_paediatric_rct/` | Code, raw harvest parameters and result tables. Re-runnable. |

## The two-paragraph summary

The atlas's own acquisition round (R18, 2026-08-06) downloaded 506 clinical trials with posted
height results and wrote that **269 of them are "natural experiments on human height that nobody has
aggregated."** They were never aggregated. This branch re-harvested the registry (841 trials, a
larger set than R18's), extracted every arm-level height contrast, and ran it. The extractor
reproduces the atlas's own hand-read positive control exactly (losartan 0.935 vs atenolol 0.822
cm/yr, NCT00429364) and recovers the known true positives (growth drugs and growth diagnoses: 35/37
positive in cm, median +0.99 cm; 11/11 positive in height-Z). Against that validated instrument,
drugs given to children for reasons unrelated to growth have a **median effect of −0.27 cm/yr and
−0.11 cm**, with only 22% of non-deficit contrasts positive. No new height-increasing lever appears.
What does appear is a **−1.7 cm, p = 0.030, 96-week randomised placebo-controlled human result for
selexipag** — the exact measurement the atlas's R457 said was missing, on a cAMP-raising agent, in
the direction that argues against the arm.

## The second summary — F-R003, and why F-R001 was the smaller half

F-R001 built a good instrument over a low-ceiling space: approved paediatric drugs, tested against
placebo, in indications unrelated to growth. It measured the base rate honestly and the base rate is
−0.27 cm/yr. **That space cannot contain a revolutionary answer, because a drug that made children
dramatically taller would not have stayed in a diabetes trial.**

F-R003 goes at the ceiling instead, and finds the crack in a different place: not in the biology, but
in the **coverage instrument**. R436 is the best thing in this repository for finding what nobody has
thought of — 21 external domain agents, 2,193 concepts, scored against the whole graph. It found 825
concepts the atlas had never once mentioned, then **scored 199 of 866**, filtered those with three
criteria (ACAN-level cartilage enrichment, ≥20 CPM in the plate, a recorded TALL direction) that
CORR-349, CORR-363, CORR-342, CORR-295 and CORR-344 each independently forbid, got four syndromes, and
recorded that the blind spot "does not hide an obvious missed compound."

**The unscored 667 are 97–100% of the mechanics, cell-biology, vascular-neural-immune and
intervention-landscape domains.** Working one of them returns the redox axis: the chondrocyte secretes
collagen at the plasma-cell ceiling (R454) in an avascular, transport-limited compartment (R448/R450/
R452), disulfide folding makes ROS, the plate pays it down through the pentose phosphate pathway,
glutathione and selenoprotein GPX4 — and when supply fails, the cell dies by a **non-apoptotic,
TUNEL-poor, necrosis-like, iron-driven** route that matches, exactly, the death morphology R459
assembled from three species and could not name. That axis has **no node, no gap and no question**
anywhere in this atlas. Its receiver passes the free local query in all four human donors — GPX4 is
detected in more cells than NPR2, the vosoritide receptor, in every one — and the zonal gradient
argues against the naive version of the model, which F-R003 reports rather than smooths.

## The third summary — F-R012, and the retraction of F-R006 through F-R011

Rounds F-R006 through F-R011 built one thesis: *charge without discharge*. The plate can make matrix
faster than it can clear it; the hypertrophic chondrocyte has exactly one exit and that exit is the
fusion mechanism; therefore unjamming the discharge should buy length. F-R011 compressed it to
`Growth = SYNTHESIS × DISCHARGE, and OXYGEN sets both`.

**F-R012 retracts it.** Stegen 2019 (Nature) ran that experiment in vivo, in both directions, with a
ruler on the tibia, and printed the answer in an Extended Data p-value list that the abstract does
not mention:

- Over-modifying a **wild-type** growth plate with dimethyl-αKG raised hydroxyproline, COL2⁺
  cartilage remnants and trabecular bone volume — and **did not change tibia length at all.**
- Un-jamming a wild-type plate with the GLS1 inhibitor BPTES **shortened the tibia at p = 1×10⁻⁷**,
  the largest length effect in the paper.
- In the PHD2-null mutant, BPTES **normalised** αKG, hydroxyproline, remnants and bone mass and
  **did not rescue length**. DCA — restoring glucose oxidation — **did** rescue length, at
  p = 1.2×10⁻⁴, while driving the remnants and the mineralised mass strictly *higher*.

**Matrix clearance is a mass valve, not a length valve.** Discharge failure diverts cartilage into
trabecular bone; it does not slow the plate's linear output. This kills the protease/cross-link/LOX
class as a height lever, confirms the atlas's αKG contraindication a second time, and explains the
entire Lublin pig corpus in one line — those are modification-arm interventions, so mass, density and
strength move and length does not.

What survives is the synthesis side: **length is a bioenergetic term, spent at prehypertrophy.**
Oohira 1974 localises it — collagen synthesis per cell is **17–20× higher** at the Zone 3/4 transition
than in the proliferative zone, in the same compartment where CORR-361 puts 44–59% of elongation and
where F-R008's bafilomycin result raised terminal cell height by 71%. And CORR-203 lands immediately
on the new candidate: DCA rescued a deficient tibia and did nothing to a wild-type one. Restoration is
not elevation. The open question the branch now carries is the one nobody has run — **raise
biosynthetic capacity at prehypertrophy in an animal that is not deficient, and measure the bone.**
